# A React application with data from the Star Wars API

This application has been built with React using data from the Star Wars API, SWAPI. When the site is loaded Star Wars films are fetched from the API. When clicking a film the characters of film are fetched and presented.

Only class-based components have been used.

The application was created for desktop with media queries for small screens.

The application is deployed @ [https://albertstjarne-starwarsapi.netlify.com/](https://albertstjarne-starwarsapi.netlify.com/)

## WIP - Next steps

As the project is work in progress, please find below next steps to dig into:

- Add spinner when data is fetched (Spinner component is added but not logic yet)
- Stop rerendering with help of PureComponent and by removing inline arrow function
- Get Close button to close the Characters component
- Transforming Characters component into a Modal
