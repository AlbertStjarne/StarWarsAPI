# A React application with data from the Star Wars API

This application has been built with React using data from the Star Wars API, SWAPI. When the site is loaded Star Wars films are fetched from the API. When clicking a film the characters of film are fetched and presented.

Only class-based components have been used.

The application was created for desktop with media queries for small screens.

The application is deployed @ [https://albertstjarne-starwarsapi.netlify.com/](https://albertstjarne-starwarsapi.netlify.com/)

## WIP - Next steps

As the project is work in progress, please find below next steps to dig into:

- Secure background color of overlay to #ecf0f1
- Make modal only being called once, now rendering one for each film
- Modal in mobile view to cover 100% of screen
